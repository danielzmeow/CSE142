# CSE142

I just use VSCode for writing codes with help of Cursor. It is not quite traditional but it is quite fun.

## Lecture 1

Try to view it as a new kind of language and learn the thinking process of using a new kind of language.

> An old convention to print "Hello, World!"

```java
public class Hello {
    //main method
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

**class** should be a word with capital letter, we'll get to the point of `public static void main(String[] args)` in Chapter VII.

**escape sequence**: \ A two character sequence to represent a single character.
