# CSE142
Personal clone of [CSE142](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMnqwkW7oW7EhGxyJ1peKXC-d7JfBVS6N), which is a Java introductory course by University of Washington. Since I do have little experience in coding, I use the style I like to code the programmes.

I do hope one day, it can remind me of my **original intention** of my final decision of learning computer science, which is to contribute to the foundation of the world.
